## Introduction

Here, we create the graphs showing how diamonds are priced depend on not only the number of carat, but their cut, color, and clarity.

* **Cut:** Quality of the diamonds (Ideal, Premium, Very Good, Good, Fair).

* **Color:** Colour of diamonds from the best to the worst (D, E, F, G, H, I).

* **Clarity:** Measurement of how clear the diamond is from the best to the worst (IF, VVS2, VVS1, VS2, VS1, SI2, SI1, I1).

## Overview

* The application is written in Shiny, a web application framework for R.

* The source code consists of two files: server.R and ui.R.

* server.R includes the backend of a Shiny web application.

* ui.R includes the the user-interface elements.

* The application is hosted on Rstudioâ€™s shiny server.
